# Object-Detector
This project implements a real-time Object Detection system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model and the COCO dataset. The system identifies and labels multiple objects in images or video streams with high accuracy.

Key Features:

Uses YOLOv5 pre-trained model for object detection

Detects 80+ object categories (person, car, dog, etc.)

Supports real-time webcam detection and image/video file input

Outputs results with bounding boxes and confidence scores

Built with Python, OpenCV, and PyTorch

Tech Stack:

Python

OpenCV

PyTorch / YOLOv5

NumPy

Use Case Examples:

Real-time surveillance

Traffic monitoring

Smart retail or object tracking applications

Future Improvements:

Integrate custom object classes

Add object tracking

Deploy as a web app with Django or Flask
